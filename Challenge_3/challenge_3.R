# Write a program that computes the DFT of a given vector of polynomial coefficients using a recursive FFT algorithm.
# Print out a trace after every merge. Print the coefficients of the merged polynomial.

# input:
#	- The first argument to the program is the length of the vector (the number of polynomial coefficients)
#	- The second argument to the program
